## Testing Recommendations

### Part 1 - Installation Orders:
1. Create a new installation schedule and verify windows_count field appears
2. Edit an existing installation schedule and verify windows_count can be updated
3. View installation details and verify windows_count displays correctly
4. Check daily schedule view for proper windows_count display

### Part 2 - Warehouse Staff:
1. Create a warehouse staff user in admin panel
2. Assign a warehouse to the user
3. Login as warehouse staff and verify:
   - Navigation shows only cutting system and assigned warehouse
   - Main cutting orders page shows only incomplete orders
   - Completed orders page is accessible
   - Cannot access other system sections
4. Test filtering on completed orders page:
   - Filter by warehouse
   - Filter by status
   - Search functionality
5. Verify regular staff still have full access
6. Test that warehouse staff without assigned warehouse cannot access system

---

## Security Considerations

1. ✅ Warehouse staff validation at model level (clean() method)
2. ✅ Permission checks in views (get_queryset() and get_user_warehouses())
3. ✅ Navigation restrictions in templates
4. ✅ Database-level foreign key constraints
5. ✅ Proper user role checking using hasattr() for backward compatibility

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. Add warehouse staff dashboard with statistics
2. Implement notifications for warehouse staff
3. Add export functionality for completed orders
4. Create warehouse staff activity logs
5. Add bulk actions for cutting orders
6. Implement warehouse staff performance metrics
